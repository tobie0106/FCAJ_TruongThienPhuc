#### Goal
Verify that the frontend artifacts exist in the S3 bucket and are ready to be integrated with CloudFront or the deployment pipeline.
### Check the file list
In the Files and folders tab, confirm that the bucket contains:

- `index.html`
- `favicon.svg`
- `icons.svg`
- `assets/index-*.js`
- `assets/index-*.css`

### File meaning
- `index.html`: entry point of the single-page application.
- `assets/index-*.js`: bundled JavaScript containing UI logic and API calls.
- `assets/index-*.css`: frontend styling.
- `favicon.svg` and `icons.svg`: static icon assets.

### Conclusion
The frontend was uploaded successfully. Next, we validate the authentication layer, GraphQL API, and Lambda backend used by the frontend.
