### Result
The bucket contains 5 frontend files:

- `index.html`
- JavaScript bundle in the `assets/` folder
- CSS bundle in the `assets/` folder
- `favicon.svg`
- `icons.svg`

The screenshot shows Succeeded: 5 files, 611.4 KB (100%), confirming that the frontend artifacts were uploaded to S3 successfully.

### Security note
When this bucket is connected to CloudFront, it should not be publicly readable. Use CloudFront Origin Access Control or Origin Access Identity so only CloudFront can read objects from the bucket.
