#### Workshop summary

Congratulations, you have completed the TaskManager workshop. In this workshop, you validated:

- IAM dashboard and basic security recommendations.
- S3 bucket containing the frontend build output.
- Cognito User Pool `taskmanager-users-dev`.
- AppSync GraphQL API `TaskManagerAPI-dev`.
- Lambda functions for backend logic.
- DynamoDB tables, Global Secondary Index, and PITR.
- CloudWatch log groups for the Lambda backend.

#### Clean up resources

If you no longer need the TaskManager environment, clean up resources to avoid additional cost.

1. Delete frontend objects in the `taskmanager-frontend-dev-*` S3 bucket.

{{% notice warning %}}
Before deleting DynamoDB tables or the Cognito User Pool, make sure the data is no longer required. PITR only helps within the configured recovery window when restore is handled correctly.

#### Conclusion

TaskManager is a complete example of a serverless application on AWS: static frontend hosting, managed authentication, GraphQL API, Lambda compute, DynamoDB database, and CloudWatch observability.
