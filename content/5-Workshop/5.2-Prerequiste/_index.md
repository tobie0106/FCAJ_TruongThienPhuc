#### Goal
This section validates the AWS account, Region, IAM permissions, and prerequisites before reviewing the TaskManager system.
### Region
The workshop uses **Asia Pacific (Singapore) - ap-southeast-1** for the main services: Cognito, AppSync, Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and CloudWatch.
### Validate IAM
1. Open the AWS Management Console.
2. Search for IAM.
3. Review the IAM dashboard to confirm the account has basic security controls.

The dashboard shows that MFA is enabled for the root user and there are no active root access keys. These are important security recommendations for an AWS account.
### Required permissions
The IAM user or role used in this workshop needs access to the following services:

- Amazon S3: upload frontend assets.
- Amazon Cognito: review User Pool and App Client settings.
- AWS AppSync: review GraphQL API, endpoint, and authorization mode.
- AWS Lambda: review function list and runtime configuration.
- Amazon DynamoDB: review tables, indexes, capacity mode, and PITR.
- Amazon CloudWatch: review log groups and log streams.
- IAM: review roles and policies related to Lambda, AppSync, and deployment.
### Resource naming convention
The workshop resources use the `dev` suffix for the development environment:

- `taskmanager-frontend-dev-*`
- `taskmanager-users-dev`
- `TaskManagerAPI-dev`
- `userManager-dev`
- `boardManager-dev`
- `taskProcessor-dev`
- `streamProcessor-dev`
- `TaskManager-Boards-dev`
- `TaskManager-Tasks-dev`
- `TaskManager-Users-dev`

### Prerequisite checklist
- Sign in to the correct AWS account.
- Select the `ap-southeast-1` Region.
- Confirm the IAM user or role can view the required resources.
- Prepare the frontend build output, including `index.html`, JavaScript bundle, CSS bundle, and static SVG assets.
